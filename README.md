Code examples for the moored optode data processing steps described in the manuscript "Oxygen optodes on oceanographic moorings: protocols for deployment and in-situ calibration".

Example 1: An optode deployed at 77db depth. Not examined for reversible drift. \\
Example 2: An optode deployed at 1000db depth. Examined for reversible drift - none detected. \\
Example 3: An optode deployed at 2300 db. Examined for reversible drift - slow drift detected and corrected for. \\
